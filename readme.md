# Duplicate detection

MINHASHING WORKS

But do not forget to implement a similarity metric now using golden labels

Impove on representation
Tune MinHashLSH (look at how it seems to be hashing )
Run to get results
Write tests and comments (organize code)

Write paper

Try Wasserstein distance instead of Jaccard similarity
